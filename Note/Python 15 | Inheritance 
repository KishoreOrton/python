Python 15 | INHERITANCE

Acquiring all the Attributes (Variables) and Methods from one class to another class

Benefit -
 We can re-use the code which saves time
Avoid duplication

parent --> properties
child --> parent properties

Class A -->  a, b, c  m1() m2 ()    --> A is parent of B class    [Base class / Super class]
Class B --> x, y, z   m3()          --> B is child of A class     { Sub class / Derived class]

When this is useful ??

1. Code reuse
2. Duplication

Types of Inheritance
1. Single
2. Multi level
3. Hierarchy
4. Multiple
