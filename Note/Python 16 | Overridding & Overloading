Python 16 | Overriding and Overloading [polymorphism]


Method Overloading in Python
What is Method Overloading?
In oops we have different types of elements like Object, Class and etc. in these elements we implement the re-usability in tow elements are Inheritance and Polymorphism.
In this topic, Method overloading is in the Polymorphism.

Polymorphism is a technique of producing different functionality with a single format.Here we have two types of polymorphism.
 Method Overloading is the class having methods that are the same name with different arguments.
 Arguments different will be based on a number of arguments and types of arguments.
 It is used in a single class.
 It is also used to write the code clarity as well as reduce complexity.

 Method Overriding:
Method Overriding is the method having the same name with the same arguments.
It is implemented with inheritance also.
It mostly used for memory reducing processes.
